### 1 -Project Description.  

The overall objective of this module was to create a web site that presents UFO sightings data for UFO aficionados that wish to look at a bit of detailed data.

The web uses Bootstrap elements such as a NavBar, Jumbotron and grid style tables to present an article on UFO sighting and load up a table of JSON UFO sighting data. The app presents filters by Date, City, State, Country and Shape that allow the web user to filter the data as they wish using this fields.  CSS is also used for some basic web styling.  The app uses arrow function and forEach loop to   handle the filters. 

*Room for improvement:* It would be much better to have a larger dataset for this web, and also present a way to search for text within the Comments field.
